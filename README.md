# Prisoners-dilemma-data-analysis

This repository contains some simple analysis and raw data for the prisoner's dilemma game we ran on Facebook a few years back. Please don't share the data with anyone, as in it's current state it might still be possible to recover identities. 

The two pdf files show some summary statistics from the analysis of the data back then (some of that data is not available to you due to privacy concerns, I can anonymize and give it to you if you need it).

Key notes:
 1- For this data set, the "usr" means the responder (moves second), and the "opp" means the requester (moves first).
 
 2- Different stages of the game have different payoffs (they are described as the payoff to the user under CC, SC, CS, SS). CC is for both cooperating, SS for both defecting, and CS for user cooperating and opponent defecting.
 
 3- Each row is a completed game. 
 
 4- History/memory data are numbered as this: memory_0 means oldest memory, and memory_9 means the most recent memory. History is about user moves overall, memory is about direct interactions with the same opponent.
 
 5-user history was shown to the opponent (0 means they defected 0 percent of the last 5 games, 100 means they defected 100 percent of last five games overall).
